      <h2>What is ToysInc?</h2>
      <p>We are a company dedicated to creating inclusive toys for children. At this current moment in
        time, there is very little products within the toy market that cater to representing children with
        disabilities. With our cutting-edge tech, children will have the option to design and create a doll
        that looks just like them Even better, 10% of our profits from every sale goes towards charities
        that support children with disabilities.  We do this by first creating a website application where
        customers can go through the journey of the ‘design process’. This will take them through step
        by step how they want their doll to look, with the options to adapt the doll to match a disability
        a child may have, such as congenital amputation (where a child is born without a limb/limbs or part
        of a limb) and many more options.  Once the customer is happy with their design, this is then sent
        onto our manufacturing team, where 3D printers allow the designs to come to life.</p>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>ToysInc was a shared idea between 5 Senior Developers with decades of experience, who have diverse
        backgrounds into inclusivity, design, 3D printing and the toy manufacturing market. Our vision is simple,
        to create toys for children who may have disabilities and to promote active inclusion.</p>
      <h2>Key Partners</h2>
      <p>One of our key partners is the Paralympics. We have acquired a contract with them to create and produce
        toys of Paralympians for the event and in addition to this all our shareholders receive complimentary
        tickets to the event. Some of our other key partners include various schools, children’s hospitals and
        some key influencers that boosted our presence on social media channels.</p>
